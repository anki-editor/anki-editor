* anki-editor

anki-editor is an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] minor mode for making [[https://apps.ankiweb.net][Anki]] cards with [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]].

This repository is a fork of [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][louietan/anki-editor]]. By now there are quite a few differences and extensions compared to the original:
- The develop branch of the original has been merged into the master branch; see the unreleased section of [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/blob/master/Changelog.org][Changelog.org]] for a list of the new features that come with this.
- Almost all outstanding pull requests to the original have been integrated; [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/issues/10][this issue]] tracks the two exceptions.
- A more flexible note structure, outlined [[https://github.com/eyeinsky/org-anki/issues/48#issuecomment-1216625730][here]], has been introduced.
- The commands to push notes, delete notes, and insert notes have been improved.
- A [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/issues/13][transient interface]] to all commands has been created.

See the [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor/compare/master...orgtre:anki-editor:master][commit log]] for a full list of differences. Note that this README does not reflect all the changes and additions yet.


** Installation

*** External dependencies

Other than Emacs you need [[https://apps.ankiweb.net][Anki]], its [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect][AnkiConnect]] add-on, and [[https://curl.se][curl]] to use anki-editor. Because of AnkiConnect, anki-editor-mode needs Anki to be running (see [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/issues/5#issuecomment-1295857747][issue]] for explanation).

*** Using ~package-vc.el~

If you are on Emacs 29 and newer, you can use ~package-vc-install~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-vc-install
   '(anki-editor . (:url "https://github.com/anki-editor/anki-editor")))
#+END_SRC

Additionally, [[https://github.com/slotThe/vc-use-package][vc-use-package]] provides use-package integration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package anki-editor
    :vc (:fetcher github :repo anki-editor/anki-editor))
#+end_src

Alternatively, if you're on Emacs 30, a ~:vc~ keyword is built into use-package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package anki-editor
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/anki-editor/anki-editor" :rev :newest))
#+end_src

*** Manually

If you're using the built-in =package.el= package manager, first manually download this repository and then type the following in Emacs:

: M-x package-install-file [RET] "path/to/anki-editor.el" [RET]

You can also first visit =anki-editor.el= in an Emacs buffer and then type =M-x package-install-from-buffer [RET]=. Both will install the anki-editor package, including uninstalled Elisp dependencies, into =package-user-dir= (=~/.emacs.d/elpa= by default), generate autoloads, and set up =load-path=.

*** Using straight.el

If you're using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] as package manager, install by adding this to your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package anki-editor
  :defer t
  :straight (:repo "anki-editor/anki-editor"))
#+end_src

*** With Doom Emacs

If you use Doom Emacs, add the following to ~packages.el~ and ~config.el~ respectively.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package! anki-editor
    :recipe (:host github :repo "anki-editor/anki-editor"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package! anki-editor)
#+end_src

*** With Spacemacs

If you use Spacemacs, you can add ~anki-editor~ to ~dotspacemacs-additional-packages~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   ;; …
   dotspacemacs-additional-packages
   '((anki-editor
      :location (recipe
                 :fetcher github
                 :repo "anki-editor/anki-editor")))
   ;; …
   )
#+end_src

** Usage

*** The Layout of Notes
**** Note and Fields General Information
   The power of this mode comes from the builtin HTML export backend
   provided by Org, which enables you to use almost all the Org
   constructs for writing Anki notes: lists, code blocks, tables,
   latex and so on.

   The structure of a note is as follows, which is inspired by
   ~org-drill~.  Check out [[./examples.org][examples.org]] for more examples.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,* Raining                                                      :vocab:idioms:
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ANKI_DECK: English
       :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic (and reversed card)
       :ANKI_TAGS: vocab idioms
       :END:
     ,** Front
        (it's) raining cats and dogs
     ,** Back
        it's raining very hard
     ,* Is there a shorter way to write notes?
        :PROPERTIES:
        :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
        :END:

     ,** Back

        Yes, like this one, Front is missing, ~anki-editor~ will use note
        heading as Front.  This is neat as sometimes it's verbose to repeat
        the same content in note heading and first field.

        This works for all note types, just make one field absent and
        ~anki-editor~ will use note heading as that missing field.

     ,* Is there a an even shorter way to write notes?
        :PROPERTIES:
        :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
        :END:

        Yes, like this one, Front and Back is missing, ~anki-editor~ will use note
        heading as Front and the text after as Back.  This is neat as sometimes it's verbose to repeat
        the same content in note heading and first field.

        This works for all note types, just make the first 2 fields absent and
        ~anki-editor~ will use note heading as first field and the text below the heading as second field.

     ,* You can extract a field value from an org-property
        :PROPERTIES:
        :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
        :ANKI_FIELD_FRONT: Can one define an anki-field inside an org-mode property?
        :ANKI_PREPEND_HEADING: nil
        :END:

        Yes. In this example, =anki-editor=  will use the =ANKI_FIELD_FRONT= property value as
        a front side of the Anki card and the body of the card as its back.

     ,** Front
        Notice that property fields will override subheading fields.
        This block will be skipped

     ,* Notes can be nested and intermixed with regular content
        :PROPERTIES:
        :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
        :ANKI_FIELD_FRONT: Can you have a note embedded in a higher level heading?
        :ANKI_NO_SUBHEADING_FIELDS: t
        :END:

        Yes, =anki-editor= can be told to not interpret subheadings as fields at all.

     ,** More on this topic
        This will not be considered as a field of the above note. It can be also turned into a note on its own.
   #+END_SRC

   - Anki deck is provided by ~ANKI_DECK~ property.  This property is
     retrieved with inheritance, that is to say, it can be put in any
     ancestor entries or at top of the file by ~#+PROPERTY: ANKI_DECK DeckName~.
   - Sub decks (nested decks) are supported via ~::~ delimiters.
     For example, to push a card to the sub deck ~SubDeck~ inside of
     ~SuperDeck~, set ~:ANKI_DECK:~ to ~SuperDeck::SubDeck~.
   - ~ANKI_NOTE_TYPE~ property is to specify the Anki note type of a
     note and is also required for identifying an Anki note entry.
   - Anki tags can be provided in two ways:
     1. With a ~ANKI_TAGS~ property, multiple tags are separated by spaces
     2. With Org tags [fn:1], this could be turned off if you would
        like to keep Org tags separated from Anki tags
   - Child entries of a note entry are fields.

   Typing all these information by hand could be inefficient and prone
   to errors, so this package provides an interactive command
   ~anki-editor-insert-note~ to help with this and hooks up
   auto-completions for decks, note types and tags etc.

[fn:1] It should be noted that Org only allows letters, numbers, =_=
and ~@~ in a tag but Anki allows more, so you may have to edit you
Anki tags before they can be used in Org without any surprise.
**** Controlling HTML Formatting
By default, anki-editor converts Org syntax to HTML when exporting to Anki.
The =:ANKI_FORMAT: nil= property can be used at the *note* level to disable this conversion for the entire note.

If you want to use both raw text fields and HTML-converted fields within a single note, you can now use the =# raw= prefix *within a field* to indicate that the field's content should be treated as raw text, bypassing HTML conversion.
Any spaces, tabs, or newlines immediately following =# raw= are ignored.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Example Note with Mixed Formatting
:PROPERTIES:
:ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
:END:

,** Front
This field will be converted to HTML.
- This is a list.
- It will be rendered as an HTML list.

,** Back
# raw
This field will be treated as RAW text.
It will be sent to Anki exactly as written.
#+END_SRC

*** Functions and Macros

**** anki-editor-map-note-entries

    Simple wrapper that calls ~org-map-entries~ with
    ~&ANKI_NOTE_TYPE<>\"\"~ appended to MATCH.

**** anki-editor-api-call

    Invoke AnkiConnect with ACTION and PARAMS.

**** anki-editor-api-call-result

    Calls above, returns result field or raise an error.

**** anki-editor-api-with-multi

    Used in combination with ~anki-editor-api-enqueue~ to queue
    multiple api calls and combine them into one 'multi' call at the
    end, return the results of these calls in the same order.

    Usage:
    #+begin_src elisp
      (cl-destructuring-bind (decks models tags notes)
          (anki-editor-api-with-multi
           ;; The following api calls will be combined into one 'multi' call.
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'deckNames)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'modelNames)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'getTags)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'findNotes :query "deck:Default"))
        (message (concat "decks: %S\n"
                         "models: %S\n"
                         "tags: %S\n"
                         "notes: %S")
                 decks models tags notes))
    #+end_src

**** anki-editor-api-enqueue

    Like ~anki-editor-api-call~, but is only used in combination with
    ~anki-editor-api-with-multi~.  Instead of sending the request
    directly, it simply queues the request.

**** anki-editor-note-at-point

    Make a note struct from current entry.

**** anki-editor-find-notes

    Find notes with QUERY.

**** anki-editor-copy-styles

    Copy ~org-html-style-default~ and ~anki-editor-html-head~ to Anki card stylings.

**** anki-editor-remove-styles

    Remove from card stylings html tags generated by this mode.

** Limitations

*** Tags between Anki and Org

   Because the set of characters allowed in tags is different between
   Anki and Org, you have to make sure that tags from Anki are
   compatible with Org and tags in Org could be recognized by Anki.

*** Working with Anki add-ons

   This package might not work well with certain Anki add-ons
   especially those who extend the builtin Anki note editor to
   automatically fill note field content (e.g. ~Add note id~).

*** One Way Sync with Anki

To sync anki notes and decks to org see ([[https://github.com/orgtre/ankiorg][orgtre/ankiorg]]).

The following items are not synchronized to org:
 - Deletion of Notes
 - Deck Changes
