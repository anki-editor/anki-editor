* anki-editor

anki-editor is an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] minor for making [[https://apps.ankiweb.net][Anki]] cards with [[https://orgmode.org][Org]].

This repository contains a fork of [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][louietan/anki-editor]]. So far the main difference is that the changes in the develop branch of the original have been merged into the master branch. See the unreleased section of [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/blob/master/Changelog.org][Changelog.org]] for a list of the new features that come with this. Additionally, a more flexible note structure, outlined [[https://github.com/eyeinsky/org-anki/issues/48#issuecomment-1216625730][here]], has been introduced. See the [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor/compare/master...orgtre:anki-editor:master][commit log]] for a full list of differences.


** Installation

*** External dependencies

Other than Emacs you need [[https://apps.ankiweb.net][Anki]], its [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect][AnkiConnect]] add-on, and [[https://curl.se][curl]] to use anki-editor. Because of AnkiConnect, anki-editor-mode needs Anki to be running (see [[https://github.com/orgtre/anki-editor/issues/5#issuecomment-1295857747][issue]] for explanation).

*** Using package.el

If you're using the built-in =package.el= package manager, first manually download this repository and then type the following in Emacs: 

: M-x package-install-file [RET] "path/to/anki-editor.el" [RET]

You can also first visit =anki-editor.el= in an Emacs buffer and then type =M-x package-install-from-buffer [RET]=. Both will install the anki-editor package, including uninstalled Elisp dependencies, into =package-user-dir= (=~/.emacs.d/elpa= by default), generate autoloads, and set up =load-path=.

*** Using straight.el

If you're using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] as package manager, install by adding this to your =init.el=:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package anki-editor  
  :straight (:host github :repo "orgtre/anki-editor")
  :commands anki-editor-mode)
#+end_src

** Usage

*** The Layout of Notes

   The power of this mode comes from the builtin HTML export backend
   provided by Org, which enables you to use almost all the Org
   constructs for writing Anki notes: lists, code blocks, tables,
   latex and so on.

   The structure of a note is as follows, which is inspired by
   ~org-drill~.  Check out [[./examples.org][examples.org]] for more examples.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,* Raining                                                      :vocab:idioms:
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ANKI_DECK: English
       :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic (and reversed card)
       :ANKI_TAGS: vocab idioms
       :END:
     ,** Front
        (it's) raining cats and dogs
     ,** Back
        it's raining very hard
   #+END_SRC

   - Anki deck is provided by ~ANKI_DECK~ property.  This property is
     retrieved with inheritance, that is to say, it can be put in any
     ancestor entries or at top of the file by ~#+PROPERTY: ANKI_DECK
     DeckName~.
   - ~ANKI_NOTE_TYPE~ property is to specify the Anki note type of a
     note and is also required for identifying an Anki note entry.
   - Anki tags can be provided in two ways:
     1. With a ~ANKI_TAGS~ property, multiple tags are separated by spaces
     2. With Org tags [fn:1], this could be turned off if you would
        like to keep Org tags separated from Anki tags
   - Child entries of a note entry are fields.

   Typing all these information by hand could be inefficient and prone
   to errors, so this package provides an interactive command
   ~anki-editor-insert-note~ to help with this and hooks up
   auto-completions for decks, note types and tags etc.

[fn:1] It should be noted that Org only allows letters, numbers, =_=
and ~@~ in a tag but Anki allows more, so you may have to edit you
Anki tags before they can be used in Org without any surprise.

*** Functions and Macros

**** anki-editor-map-note-entries

    Simple wrapper that calls ~org-map-entries~ with
    ~&ANKI_NOTE_TYPE<>\"\"~ appended to MATCH.

**** anki-editor-api-call

    Invoke AnkiConnect with ACTION and PARAMS.

**** anki-editor-api-call-result

    Calls above, returns result field or raise an error.

**** anki-editor-api-with-multi

    Used in combination with ~anki-editor-api-enqueue~ to queue
    multiple api calls and combine them into one 'multi' call at the
    end, return the results of these calls in the same order.

    Usage:
    #+begin_src elisp
      (cl-destructuring-bind (decks models tags notes)
          (anki-editor-api-with-multi
           ;; The following api calls will be combined into one 'multi' call.
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'deckNames)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'modelNames)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'getTags)
           (anki-editor-api-enqueue 'findNotes :query "deck:Default"))
        (message (concat "decks: %S\n"
                         "models: %S\n"
                         "tags: %S\n"
                         "notes: %S")
                 decks models tags notes))
    #+end_src

**** anki-editor-api-enqueue

    Like ~anki-editor-api-call~, but is only used in combination with
    ~anki-editor-api-with-multi~.  Instead of sending the request
    directly, it simply queues the request.

**** anki-editor-note-at-point

    Make a note struct from current entry.

**** anki-editor-find-notes

    Find notes with QUERY.

**** anki-editor-copy-styles

    Copy `org-html-style-default' and `anki-editor-html-head' to Anki card stylings.

**** anki-editor-remove-styles

    Remove from card stylings html tags generated by this mode.

** Limitations

*** Tags between Anki and Org

   Because the set of characters allowed in tags is different between
   Anki and Org, you have to make sure that tags from Anki are
   compatible with Org and tags in Org could be recognized by Anki.

*** Working with Anki add-ons

   This package might not work well with certain Anki add-ons
   especially those who extend the builtin Anki note editor to
   automatically fill note field content (e.g. ~Add note id~).

*** One Way Sync with Anki
To sync anki notes and decks to org see ([[https://github.com/orgtre/ankiorg][orgtre/ankiorg]]).

The following items are not synchronized to org:
 - Deletion of Notes
 - Deck Changes
 - Note Type Changes
